# NVIM

TODO:
 - telescope different window formatting for different views
 - telescope live grep magic mode and some magic in general maybe
 - make cmp a bit faster ans smarter - top highlight is ususally good, rely on fzf rather than anything else. Disable snippets and figure out how to focus on the mini window
 - use fzf for more things? or maybe use Noice.nvim? make messages prettier, code actions better
 - filter for errors in the diagnostics easily (<leader> + fe?)
 - figure out why the hell do I have library LSP stuff in my diagnostics
 - clear bottom messages every n seconds. could be fixed with noice ig?
